/*  9.Write a program in C to find the net salary of an employee where the basic salary will be
accepted as input through keyboard. For calculation of net salary you are to consider the
following:
Gross Salary = Basic Salary + HRA + DA, where
HRA = 30 % of Basic Salary, DA = 119 % of Basic Salary,
Deductions are as follows:
PF = 12 % of Basic Salary, PTAX = 200.
Net Salary = Gross Salary â€“ Deductions .*/
